	INPUTS:
	lotman_JSON_str:
		A string defining the lot in JSON (see below for lot object specification)

	err_msg:
		A reference to a char array that can store any error messages.

	Lot Object specification:
{   "lot_name":
		REQUIRED: A string indicating the name of the lot.
	"owner":
		REQUIRED: A string indicating the entity that "owns" the contents of the lot. Ownership of a lot
		indicates ownership of the lots contents, but not the lot itself; like renting a garden --
		you own what you grow, but not the dirt you grow it in. A lot owner cannot modify the lot's
		properties unless the lot is a self parent. However, the owner can modify the properties of
		any sub lots.
	"parents":
		REQUIRED: An array of strings indicating any lots that are parent to the lot about to be added.
		Any parents specified must already exist in the lot database, unless the specified parent
		is the lot itself. At least one parent must be specified.
	"children":
		OPTIONAL: An array of strings indicating any lots that are children of the lot about to be added.
		Any children must already exist in the lot database. A lot should not specify itself as
		a child, as this case is already handled by the self parent mechanism.
	"paths":
		OPTIONAL: An array of `path` objects that are used to associate paths/objects to the lot. Each
		path object has the following structure:
		{"path": "/path/to/associate", "recursive": bool}
		When "recursive" is true, all subdirectories of the path are also attributed to the lot. When false,
		only non-directory objects below the path should be attributed, but any subdirectories should not be.
	"management_policy_attrs":
		REQUIRED: A JSON object containing the collection of attributes used for creating policies for the
		lot. The object has the following structure:

	{   "dedicated_GB":
			REQUIRED: A double indicating the size in GB of dedicated storage a lot possesses. During a lot's
			lifespan, this is the amount of persistent storage it should be allowed to access.
		"opportunistic_GB":
			REQUIRED: A double indicating the size in GB of opportunistic storage a lot possesses. During a
			lot's lifespan, this is the amount of extra storage it should be able to access after all
			dedicated storage has been exhausted if the system determines there is unused capacity. Opp
			storage should be considered transient, and as such, depending on the management policy, lots
			that are using some amount of opp storage may be subject to purging in the event that the system
			needs to create space.
		"max_num_objects": An int64 indicating the maxiximum number of objects a lot may have attributed to it.
		"creation_time":
			REQUIRED: A Unix timestamp in milliseconds indicating when the lot should begin its existence.
		"expiration_time":
			REQUIRED: A Unix timestamp in milliseconds indicating when the lot "expires". In a similar vein
			as opp storage, a lot and its storage become transient after its expiration time has passed. If
			the system determines there is unused space, the lot may continue to exist, but all storage tied
			to the lot should be considered opportunistic.
		"deletion_time":
			REQUIRED: A Unix timestamp in milliseconds indicating when the lot and its contents should be deleted.

		the proper policy/parent reassignments for children lots according to the selection of options. These
		reassignments are necessary to preserve the lot database's structure.
		NOTE: Deleting a lot does not actually affect the objects tied to the lot. It only removes the lot from the
			lot database.
		NOTE: Lotman must be called with the correct context set for a lot to be successfully deleted. When deleting a

		orphaned by LTBR's removal. If true, any lots whose only parent is currently LTBR will be reassigned to
		have LTBR's parents as explicit parents. If false, any orphans will automatically be reassigned to have
		the default lot as a parent.
		NOTE: If LTBR is a root (ie it has only itself as a parent) and this option is true, the function should
			fail with an indication that the child could not be reassigned because LTBR has no parents. This is
			to explicitly ensure the user is aware the orphans must be reassigned to the default lot.

	assign_LTBR_parent_as_parent_to_non_orphans:
		A bool indicating whether LotMan should attempt to assign LTBR's parents as the new parents to any lots
		that are not orphaned by LTBR's removal. If true, any non-orphans will be updated to have LTBR's parents
		as explicit parents. If false, LTBR will be removed as a parent from the non-orphaned children and no extra
		parents will be added.
		NOTE: If a child of LTBR has only LTBR and itself as a parent, setting this option to false will cause that
			child to become a root.
		NOTE: If LTBR is a root and this option is true, the function should fail with an indication that the child
			could not be reassigned because LTBR has no parents.

	assign_policy_to_children:
		A bool indicating whether LTBR's management policy attributes should be assigned to its children. If true,
		LTBR's children will have their policy attributes overwritten by LTBR's.

	override_policy:
		THIS FEATURE IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. A bool indicating whether a lot's stored deletion policy should be
		overwritten by the other options. If true, the lot will be deleted according to other options. If false,

	if the paths '/foo' and '/foo/bar' are both tracked by LotMan and it is reported that '/foo' contains
	10 objects totalling 2GB, an additional object is required so that LotMan can decrement whatever
	is being used by '/foo/bar' from '/foo's statistics. If the additional object reports that '/foo/bar'
